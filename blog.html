                  <p>
                    On the evening of July 4th, the ACM Student Chapter at SSN
                    conducted a virtual workshop on the essentials for coding
                    interviews to spur up the preparation process for the
                    placement season. Vrishin Vigneshwar, an ACM-ICPC finalist
                    and the incoming SDE at Motorq, delivered a 2-hour
                    interactive session highlighting the essential preparation
                    steps to perform well in placements, with a detailed
                    emphasis on crucial competitive programming topics. This
                    chapter's first intra-college event of the academic year
                    witnessed an overwhelming turnout of around 400 students
                    with interactive Q&A throughout its duration. The first hour
                    of the workshop pivoted around the competitive programming
                    concepts that are frequently tested in programming
                    interviews. The speaker attributed different levels of
                    importance to each topic and categorized their relevance in
                    technical rounds of different tiers of recruiters. Among the
                    significant topics were dynamic programming, prefix sums,
                    two-pointer problems, trees and graphs to underscore a few.
                    The speaker shared his personal learning experience, links
                    to online resources and empirical opinions concerning each
                    topic to help the audience devise a more streamlined and
                    time-effective preparation plan. The latter part of the
                    session stressed the gravity of and the parts involved in
                    developing, putting together and publicizing a striking
                    personal profile. The speaker urged the students to build a
                    one-page resume, accentuating their most marketable skills
                    and work, to regularly update their LinkedIn profiles with
                    all their activities and accomplishments and maintain their
                    software projects on sharable code repositories like Github,
                    among other key steps. A few noteworthy projects with a good
                    visual appeal and indicative of sound proficiency in the
                    concerned tools and architectures will strengthen the
                    profiles. Finally, the speaker shared a few crucial pointers
                    about ‚Äúthe interview psyche‚Äù and recommended that students
                    take up mock interviews. He also laid out a detailed roadmap
                    for students in each year of study, indicating what aspect
                    of the preparation process they could focus on and how much
                    depth and time they should attribute to each, given the
                    amount of preparation time they have until the placements
                    commence. A consolidated e-document, outlining all the
                    topics discussed during the session and links to topic-wise
                    learning resources, personally curated by the speaker, were
                    handed out to the participants post the workshop. The event
                    received remarkably positive feedback from the participants,
                    thanking the speaker and the organizers for an effective and
                    time-pertinent workshop.

                    The ACM Student Chapter hosted a talk on the 11th of July to
                    demystify career options after graduation and empower
                    students to make an informed pursuit of their goals. Satish
                    Palaniappan, Software Engineer at Microsoft and an alumnus
                    of SSN, addressed the students with an outline of the
                    various possibilities and his experiential wisdom. As a
                    working professional in the US, his discussions hinged
                    around career options in India and in the US which may,
                    however, be coarsely generalized to other countries as well.
                    The 2-hour long virtual session witnessed over 120
                    participants. The talk started with a brief overview of
                    Satish's journey from SSN to a master's at the John Hopkins
                    University and the eventual realization of his dream to be a
                    Machine Learning Engineer. It was through his first
                    internship program at NIT, Karnataka that he realized his
                    passion for Machine Learning. Intimidated by the extensive
                    technical know-how of his peers, he repulsed his urge to
                    give-up and worked persistently throughout the program to
                    prove himself. Building an OCR engine for Indus Scripts that
                    gathered media attention and his novel role as a software
                    engineer at Qube Cinemas in developing ML systems to improve
                    movie-watching experience were among his cherishable
                    experiences as a beginner. Speaking emphatically, he urged
                    students to seize every opportunity to work on their
                    interests and to never fear failure. The speaker then laid
                    out the typical career routes which could include pursuing a
                    job in India and possibly transferring to one in the US
                    later, a master's abroad right after graduation or working
                    for a year or two before starting master's, to mention a
                    few. He advised students to concretely realise their end
                    goal and suitably work towards it. The talk further
                    elaborated on working towards and putting together a
                    remarkable personal profile, shortlisting potential US
                    universities and applying to them. A good balance between
                    test scores, experience and writing samples, according to
                    the speaker, is crucial to being accepted. He then gave a
                    comprehensive outline of what each aspect of the application
                    entails. Notably, he emphasized on the importance of
                    composing an effective Statement of Purpose which must
                    ideally be personalized to suit each university and markedly
                    demonstrate one's reason for choosing their school. Good
                    projects and internships, exhibiting one's depth of research
                    and hard work will register a positive impact on the
                    experience aspect and the application as a whole, he added.
                    In the latter parts of the talk, the speaker brought out
                    marked differences in the job search process between India
                    and the US. While every Indian institute boasts and asserts
                    its fame and reputation through its campus placement
                    statistics, on the flip side, this is practically an alien
                    concept in US universities. While online application portals
                    are the conventional method to apply to firms, landing job
                    interviews through referrals and peer networking is
                    remarkably more effective. Preparing and performing well in
                    the interviews is the next most critical step and the
                    speaker narrated his interview experience at Amazon and
                    Microsoft whilst describing the typical assessment
                    techniques. An eminent piece of advice in the context of job
                    seeking, often highlighted by experts as did the speaker, is
                    to prepare a fine, structured one-page resume and to be
                    vocal during interviews. The talk concluded with the speaker
                    describing his present work-life balance and nature of work
                    and addressing participant queries. The event received an
                    overall positive feedback from the participants.

                    On July 15th, the ACM Student Chapter of SSN invited Suresh
                    Kumar G, the CEO of MacApStudio and Pepul to address the
                    students. The speaker shared his journey in establishing
                    MacAppStudio and pointed out the necessary qualities and
                    expertise to build a startup. Followed by an extensive Q&A,
                    this event was attended by an audience of over 200. The
                    speaker shared his truly inspiring personal journey of
                    struggle, perseverance, and eventual success in the first
                    hour. After engineering, he joined a high-rewarding job in
                    the US. Later with hard work and determination, he and his
                    friend won Intel's Worldwide Developer challenge and came
                    first among 18000 Developers from top universities.
                    Subsequently, they won many such awards and became the
                    Youngest and First in Asia to be Intel BlackBelts.Both of
                    them left the cushy jobs and started MacAppStudio in
                    Chennai, they faced numerous hurdles and pitfalls and
                    struggled for three years. Their faith in the path chosen
                    and their value system transformed MacAppStudio into a
                    Multi-Billion dollar company. Their distinctive hiring
                    without resume process is intended to break stereotypes
                    about Developers. They rigorously train talented recruits
                    and produce hardworking and highly skilled employees. In the
                    latter part, the speaker shared some nuggets of wisdom he
                    follows using many relatable anecdotes. The most important
                    one being the power of belief, if a person believes in
                    themselves then anything can be accomplished. He motivated
                    the audience to decide on a final objective and work towards
                    that in small incremental goals. Ignore the naysayers and
                    have good intentions and thoughts. Always be ready for
                    failure and put it in perspective. Have big dreams, and
                    consistently work hard. Do not compare yourself with others,
                    have gratitude, and don't forget your origins. Contribute
                    positively to society to give meaning to your life. Finally,
                    there was a comprehensive Q&A with over 25 questions. He
                    explained in detail the vision of MacAppStudio to touch and
                    improve the lives of billions of people. How his
                    extracurricular work in design and animation helped his
                    career. He encouraged every fresher to give innovative
                    solutions to the problems in their company. Society in
                    general advocates to "Play it Safe" because of a fear of
                    failure, but if the entrepreneur is confident about taking
                    risks and the idea behind the startup solves a relevant
                    problem then success is assured. With regards to funding,
                    the Bootstrap model is preferred by the speaker because the
                    entrepreneur isn't answerable to anyone. This enabled them
                    to create a people-first business model which rewards,
                    recognition and respects the employees. A unique example of
                    this is when they hired an employee based on his ability to
                    tend to plants and trained him in project management to take
                    care of people. When asked about the secret of their success
                    he humbly replied pure intentions, support system, and hard
                    work. He reiterated that being passionate about the work a
                    person does will keep them motivated and avoid burnout. The
                    speaker's down-to-earth nature with practical inputs and
                    relatable way of addressing the audience were
                    thought-provoking and positively influenced them to dream
                    bigger and work to achieve their ambitions. The event
                    received overwhelmingly positive feedback.

                  <p>
                    The ACM Student Chapter conducted an online webinar where
                    Mr. Balaji Nagaraj Kumar, Product Manager at Volvo Cars,
                    Sweden and the Founder and CEO of DataTor Labs, Sweden, was
                    invited to be the guest speaker. As a successful engineer
                    with immense industrial experience and academic training
                    from across 5 countries in a range of fields spanning across
                    technical sciences and business management, he addressed the
                    participants with his idea and approach to building a
                    successful career path. The 2-hour long virtual session
                    witnessed over 90 participants.<br /><br />
                    To give the audience a background of his life, the speaker
                    began with a brief overview of his professional journey
                    across the world . As a young physics enthusiast, Mr. Balaji
                    chose to pursue his engineering bachelors in electrical
                    engineering. After working for 2 years at MuSigma and Ford
                    Motors, he went on to pursue his masters in a prestigious
                    fully-funded cross-university program in Europe. This
                    markedly opened up an array of opportunities for him, as he
                    developed a global academic and work exposure, experiencing
                    diverse cultures and gathering exposure along the way. ‚ÄúPlay
                    to your strengths‚Äù and ‚Äúadapt to the world around you‚Äù were
                    his words of wisdom at the end of this enthralling
                    narrative.
                    <br /><br />
                    According to the speaker, an engineering course lays the
                    foundation for thinking logically in a technical context. He
                    regarded critical thinking, implementation thinking,
                    conceptual thinking, innovation thinking and intuitive
                    thinking as the fundamental skills an engineer must look to
                    hone. With that piece of advice, he brought out the
                    differences between working in large corporate organizations
                    and embarking on startups. As a global graduate recruit at
                    Volvo, he described his experience working on real-world
                    systems as part of a global team. He spotlighted the
                    importance of effective communication skills and a strong
                    technical know-how to work among the experts in the
                    corporate world. Being an entrepreneur, on the other hand,
                    entails a lot of perseverance and an immense cross-domain
                    knowledge in combination with a strong business perspective.
                    After enduring four unsuccessful startups at different
                    points in his career, Mr. Balaji is now the founder of
                    DataTor Labs, a data-privacy firm based out of Sweden.
                    Pointing out what went wrong in each of his earlier
                    endeavors, he stressed on the need to be prepared to face
                    and learn from failures. <br /><br />
                    Finally, the speaker presented an aggregation of his
                    industrial wisdom and round-the-world exposure in the form
                    of a ‚Äúframework‚Äù to being a successful engineer and a social
                    human being as a whole, called ‚ÄúYou Design U‚Äù. It urges one
                    to understand the world around oneself and work coherently
                    with the others. It also describes a structured way to deal
                    with and solve problems along the way to carving a path to
                    and eventually realizing one's dream and destiny.
                    <br /><br />
                    Throughout this engaging session, Mr. Balaji emphasized on
                    the importance of learning at every stage of life, always
                    keeping the ‚Äúbig-picture‚Äù in mind and preparing for and
                    persevering through the inevitable downs on the way to
                    achieving one's goals. The webinar concluded with a Q&A
                    session with the speaker

                  <p>
                    October 30th, 2023 marked the SSN ACM Student Chapter
                    orientation meeting, the official beginning of the Student
                    Chapter of 2023. Assembled on the vibrant evening, the
                    team's diverse members shared a common zeal for technology.
                    Leaders elucidated the mission and introduced their teams.
                    <br /><br />
                    Sanjjit and Jeevesh started off the meet with a brief
                    introduction of what ACM is and what it does. This was
                    followed by Sarika and Gayathri who spoke about the
                    educational purposes, scientific purposes and goals of this
                    particular chapter in SSN. Following this, was the
                    introduction of each team, taken up by the head or deputy
                    heads of each vertical. Sarath and Nila then proceeded to
                    throw some light upon previous events and outreach programs
                    conducted by the SSN ACM Student Chapter.
                    <br /><br />
                    There were 63 students present in the call from across all
                    departments. They inquired about multiple aspects of the
                    club. It was clear to see that the club and its activities,
                    both future and prior, had intrigued them, and the club
                    hoped to see many of those faces in the future events. The
                    students had the opportunity to network with other members
                    of the Computer Science Department, allowing them to meet
                    new people.
                    <br /><br />
                    Haricharan introduced the ACM membership and its benefits,
                    some of which are networking and volunteering opportunities.
                    He began by first explaining the process to obtain the
                    membership: by joining the annual membership drive and
                    keeping up with the social media handles of the club for any
                    new updates. The members were then encouraged to contribute
                    to the student chapter by actively engaging in various
                    activities like volunteering, competitions and hackathons.
                    <br /><br />
                    Finally, the planned events of this year were discussed.
                    Hour of Code, the first event of this new season of SSN ACM
                    was particularly highlighted. The ideas for this event were
                    discussed, along with a brief overview of the event plan.
                    The club looks forward to the new events of the year and is
                    absolutely thrilled for a new season of SSN ACM Student
                    Chapter. They welcome everyone to join aboard this journey!

                      Unlock the Power of UNIX: A Comprehensive Workshop by
                      SSN-ACM

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    The first workshop, Introduction to UNIX commands, was
                    conducted by the SSN-ACM student chapter as a
                    beginner-oriented course to help students unlock the full
                    potential of the dynamic UNIX command line interface
                    conducted by two fourth-year students, Akil Karthikeyan and
                    Vaishnave J P. The event was overseen by the Faculty
                    coordinator Dr. Sujaudeen N with the help of student
                    coordinators Sarath Donepudi and Sarika Esackimuthu.
                    <br /><br />
                    The first day revolved around basic UNIX commands such as
                    creating, navigating and deleting directories. It was
                    followed by a detailed explanation of file permissions and
                    an understanding of the various types of ownerships. The
                    participants worked on managing and changing these
                    permissions to gain a better grasp of its nuances. Following
                    this, the concepts of piping and sorting were introduced in
                    which participants learnt how to establish temporary
                    connections between commands and manipulate the types of
                    sorting. The final concept for Day 1 was pattern matching
                    and searching using Regex and Grep. The participants were
                    guided on the various symbols and commands used to match
                    characters effectively.
                    <br /><br />
                    The second day of the workshop delved deeper into the
                    interface and explored concepts like alternation, grouping
                    and quantifiers that add more functionality to the
                    interface. The hands-on experience was provided on grouping
                    using the (?) quantifier and its capabilities. This was
                    followed by an introduction to awk, one of the most
                    prominent text-processing utilities used in UNIX. The
                    participants learned how to read commands from a text file
                    and print the contents in various formats. Side by side the
                    participants coded the awk commands and implemented line
                    counting and arrays as well as patterns. The workshop
                    concluded with a brief explanation of how awk can be used
                    for built-in variables, control flow statements, looping
                    constructs and built-in functions.
                    <br /><br />
                    All participants left the session satisfied and eager to
                    implement all that they had learned to enhance their coding
                    prowess and make the best use of the UNIX command line
                    interface!

                  <h4><strong>1. AI Trivia Challenge</strong></h4>

                  <h5>Round 1 - Crossword Puzzle</h5>

                  <p>
                    The first challenge of the day was the AI Trivia Challenge,

                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>On the evening of July 4th, the ACM Student Chapter at SSN conducted a virtual workshop on the
                  essentials for coding interviews to spur up the preparation process for the placement season. Vrishin
                  Vigneshwar, an ACM-ICPC finalist and the incoming SDE at Motorq, delivered a 2-hour interactive
                  session highlighting the essential preparation steps to perform well in placements, with a detailed
                  emphasis on crucial competitive programming topics. This chapter’s first intra-college event of the
                  academic year witnessed an overwhelming turnout of around 400 students with interactive Q&A throughout
                  its duration.

                  The first hour of the workshop pivoted around the competitive programming concepts that are frequently
                  tested in programming interviews. The speaker attributed different levels of importance to each topic
                  and categorized their relevance in technical rounds of different tiers of recruiters. Among the
                  significant topics were dynamic programming, prefix sums, two-pointer problems, trees and graphs to
                  underscore a few. The speaker shared his personal learning experience, links to online resources and
                  empirical opinions concerning each topic to help the audience devise a more streamlined and
                  time-effective preparation plan.

                  The latter part of the session stressed the gravity of and the parts involved in developing, putting
                  together and publicizing a striking personal profile. The speaker urged the students to build a
                  one-page resume, accentuating their most marketable skills and work, to regularly update their
                  LinkedIn profiles with all their activities and accomplishments and maintain their software projects
                  on sharable code repositories like Github, among other key steps. A few noteworthy projects with a
                  good visual appeal and indicative of sound proficiency in the concerned tools and architectures will
                  strengthen the profiles.

                  Finally, the speaker shared a few crucial pointers about “the interview psyche” and recommended that
                  students take up mock interviews. He also laid out a detailed roadmap for students in each year of
                  study, indicating what aspect of the preparation process they could focus on and how much depth and
                  time they should attribute to each, given the amount of preparation time they have until the
                  placements commence.

                  A consolidated e-document, outlining all the topics discussed during the session and links to
                  topic-wise learning resources, personally curated by the speaker, were handed out to the participants
                  post the workshop. The event received remarkably positive feedback from the participants, thanking the
                  speaker and the organizers for an effective and time-pertinent workshop.

                <p></p>
                <p>The ACM Student Chapter hosted a talk on the 11th of July to demystify career options after
                  graduation and empower students to make an informed pursuit of their goals. Satish Palaniappan,
                  Software Engineer at Microsoft and an alumnus of SSN, addressed the students with an outline of the
                  various possibilities and his experiential wisdom. As a working professional in the US, his
                  discussions hinged around career options in India and in the US which may, however, be coarsely
                  generalized to other countries as well. The 2-hour long virtual session witnessed over 120
                  participants.

                  The talk started with a brief overview of Satish’s journey from SSN to a master’s at the John Hopkins
                  University and the eventual realization of his dream to be a Machine Learning Engineer. It was through
                  his first internship program at NIT, Karnataka that he realized his passion for Machine Learning.
                  Intimidated by the extensive technical know-how of his peers, he repulsed his urge to give-up and
                  worked persistently throughout the program to prove himself. Building an OCR engine for Indus Scripts
                  that gathered media attention and his novel role as a software engineer at Qube Cinemas in developing
                  ML systems to improve movie-watching experience were among his cherishable experiences as a beginner.
                  Speaking emphatically, he urged students to seize every opportunity to work on their interests and to
                  never fear failure.

                  The speaker then laid out the typical career routes which could include pursuing a job in India and
                  possibly transferring to one in the US later, a master’s abroad right after graduation or working for
                  a year or two before starting master’s, to mention a few. He advised students to concretely realise
                  their end goal and suitably work towards it.

                  The talk further elaborated on working towards and putting together a remarkable personal profile,
                  shortlisting potential US universities and applying to them. A good balance between test scores,
                  experience and writing samples, according to the speaker, is crucial to being accepted. He then gave a
                  comprehensive outline of what each aspect of the application entails. Notably, he emphasized on the
                  importance of composing an effective Statement of Purpose which must ideally be personalized to suit
                  each university and markedly demonstrate one’s reason for choosing their school. Good projects and
                  internships, exhibiting one’s depth of research and hard work will register a positive impact on the
                  experience aspect and the application as a whole, he added.

                  In the latter parts of the talk, the speaker brought out marked differences in the job search process
                  between India and the US. While every Indian institute boasts and asserts its fame and reputation
                  through its campus placement statistics, on the flip side, this is practically an alien concept in US
                  universities. While online application portals are the conventional method to apply to firms, landing
                  job interviews through referrals and peer networking is remarkably more effective. Preparing and
                  performing well in the interviews is the next most critical step and the speaker narrated his
                  interview experience at Amazon and Microsoft whilst describing the typical assessment techniques. An
                  eminent piece of advice in the context of job seeking, often highlighted by experts as did the
                  speaker, is to prepare a fine, structured one-page resume and to be vocal during interviews.

                  The talk concluded with the speaker describing his present work-life balance and nature of work and
                  addressing participant queries. The event received an overall positive feedback from the participants.

                <p>On July 15th, the ACM Student Chapter of SSN invited Suresh Kumar G, the CEO of MacApStudio and Pepul
                  to address the students. The speaker shared his journey in establishing MacAppStudio and pointed out
                  the necessary qualities and expertise to build a startup. Followed by an extensive Q&A, this event was
                  attended by an audience of over 200.

                  The speaker shared his truly inspiring personal journey of struggle, perseverance, and eventual
                  success in the first hour. After engineering, he joined a high-rewarding job in the US. Later with
                  hard work and determination, he and his friend won Intel's Worldwide Developer challenge and came
                  first among 18000 Developers from top universities. Subsequently, they won many such awards and became
                  the Youngest and First in Asia to be Intel BlackBelts.Both of them left the cushy jobs and started
                  MacAppStudio in Chennai, they faced numerous hurdles and pitfalls and struggled for three years. Their
                  faith in the path chosen and their value system transformed MacAppStudio into a Multi-Billion dollar
                  company.
                  Their distinctive hiring without resume process is intended to break stereotypes about Developers.
                  They rigorously train talented recruits and produce hardworking and highly skilled employees.

                  In the latter part, the speaker shared some nuggets of wisdom he follows using many relatable
                  anecdotes. The most important one being the power of belief, if a person believes in themselves then
                  anything can be accomplished. He motivated the audience to decide on a final objective and work
                  towards that in small incremental goals. Ignore the naysayers and have good intentions and thoughts.
                  Always be ready for failure and put it in perspective. Have big dreams, and consistently work hard. Do
                  not compare yourself with others, have gratitude, and don't forget your origins. Contribute positively
                  to society to give meaning to your life.

                  Finally, there was a comprehensive Q&A with over 25 questions. He explained in detail the vision of
                  MacAppStudio to touch and improve the lives of billions of people. How his extracurricular work in
                  design and animation helped his career. He encouraged every fresher to give innovative solutions to
                  the problems in their company. Society in general advocates to "Play it Safe" because of a fear of
                  failure, but if the entrepreneur is confident about taking risks and the idea behind the startup
                  solves a relevant problem then success is assured. With regards to funding, the Bootstrap model is
                  preferred by the speaker because the entrepreneur isn't answerable to anyone. This enabled them to
                  create a people-first business model which rewards, recognition and respects the employees. A unique
                  example of this is when they hired an employee based on his ability to tend to plants and trained him
                  in project management to take care of people. When asked about the secret of their success he humbly
                  replied pure intentions, support system, and hard work. He reiterated that being passionate about the
                  work a person does will keep them motivated and avoid burnout.

                  The speaker's down-to-earth nature with practical inputs and relatable way of addressing the audience
                  were thought-provoking and positively influenced them to dream bigger and work to achieve their
                  ambitions. The event received overwhelmingly positive feedback.
